Unlike offshore campuses, which require significant capital investment and time to replicate institutional culture and infrastructure, these models operate with smaller physical footprints and can be hosted within existing international offices. They allow HEIs to focus on strategic areas such as collaborative research, joint degrees, and curriculum exchange while expanding global physical presence at a smaller scale.
